### User Logic
- User inputs the lengths for the three sides of a triangle.
- Click submission to seek output.
### Business Logic
- Define a triangle as the initial condition.
- Then check whether all sides are equal; which is termed equilateral.
- Checked if any of the two sides are equal then state as isosceles.
- If all sides are not equal then the triangle is a scalene but the sum of two sides has to be greater or equal.
- However, if the dimensions does not meet this conditions give "Not a triangle" as the return.
- Finally, confirm from user if they are done and thank them for accessing the application.
